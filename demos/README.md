# Demos

The demo `tape` files in this folder are used with [vhs] to create a `gif`.
Those `gif` files are then published using `vhs publish <file>.gif` resulting in
an URL to be used in markdown. Only the source `tape` files should be stored in
the repository not the output `gif`.

There should be one `tape` file for each feature to use used in documentation.
The `demo.tape` is the module overview.
